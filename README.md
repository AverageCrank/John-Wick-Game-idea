# John Wick Game Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This roadmap transforms your John Wick game concept into a production-ready development plan. The game combines semi-open world exploration with tight combat mechanics, featuring dynamic faction systems and escalating bounty mechanics.

## Technology Stack Recommendations

### Primary Engine: **Unreal Engine 5**
**Why UE5 is perfect for this project:**
- **Nanite virtualized geometry**: Detailed environments like Continental Hotel, NYC districts
- **Lumen global illumination**: Cinematic lighting for atmospheric scenes
- **Chaos physics**: Realistic destruction and gunfight physics
- **MetaHuman Creator**: Photorealistic NPCs (Winston, Bowery King, etc.)
- **World Partition**: Seamless open-world streaming for NYC districts
- **Blueprint visual scripting**: Rapid prototyping of complex systems

### Alternative Engine: **Unity 2023.x**
**If team prefers Unity:**
- **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**: High-quality visuals with performance
- **Addressable Assets**: Efficient content loading for open world
- **Cinemachine**: Cinematic camera work for action sequences
- **Unity NetCode**: If multiplayer contracts mode planned

### Programming Languages
- **C++** (Unreal) or **C#** (Unity) for core systems
- **Blueprint/Visual Scripting** for rapid iteration on game logic
- **Python** for build automation and content pipeline tools
